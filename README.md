WIP pack idea, might happen, might not. Just public now so people can help out

Refer to [here](https://github.com/users/ThePansmith/projects/2?pane=issue&itemId=94238107) for general philosophy of this pack.

Refer to monifactory repo for setup instructions, and ask Pansmith in pancord for the experimental projects role if you wish to contribute. (Once we get far enough in that I can reasonally confirm that this will be happening, the channel(s) would be made public.)
